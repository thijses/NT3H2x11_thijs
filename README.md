# NT3H2x11_thijs
A library for the NT3H2111 / NT3H2211 NFC tag for atmega328p, ESP32, MSP430 or STM32 (or Wire.h)
(still in development, see TODO list near top of NT3H2x11_thijs.h for details)
only a few high-level functions are still missing (and Pass-Through mode interrupt code), but the low-level base should be complete.
